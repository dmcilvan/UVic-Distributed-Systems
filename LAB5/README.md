## Project Party! This lab has 2 parts (3 if you don't have a repo yet!):


0. If you haven't already, set up a repo for your project, and put a link to it under "OUR PROJECTS" in the CourseSpaces Forum!  You will be demo-ing next week (Lab 6) based on what is there, and roughly it should contain:

* a copy of your source code, and instructions on how we can compile / run your code
* a description of the following:
 * the structure of your code, including any major interfaces you implemented
 * for example, in the 2PC project, the RPC interface your replicas expose to the coordinator
* how you handle failures
 * for example, in the 2PC project, how are failures reflected to clients via the RPC interface that the coordinator exposes, if at all
* the test cases you explored, and why you picked those, along with test cases you would do if you had more time!


1. Work on making progress on your project, and concretely identify where you could use a little help from someone who is on the outside! This could be brainstorming, sanity checking, or actual digging through code/tests! It may involve methodology, tools, coding, testing, project management... anything! Just be ready to articulate what it is you could use and hand with, as clearly as you can. Add this as an issue to the repo for your project.

2. Helping 3 other projects make progress, and having some else help you make progress with yours! Spend about 20 minutes with someone from another project, exchanging where you are at, and explaining the issue you have identified. By the end of this week, post a best-effort response for each of the issues you are helping with on the other projects.
