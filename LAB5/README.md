## Project Party! This lab has 2 parts (3 if you don't have a repo yet!):


0. If you haven't already, set up a repo for your project!

1. Work on making progress on your project, and concretely identify where you could use a little help from someone who is on the outside! This could be brainstorming, sanity checking, or actual digging through code/tests! It may involve methodology, tools, coding, testing, project management... anything! Just be ready to articulate what it is you could use and hand with, as clearly as you can. Add this as an issue to the repo for your project.

2. Helping 3 other projects make progress, and having some else help you make progress with yours! Spend about 15 minutes with someone from another project, exchanging where you are at, and explaining the issue you have identified. By the end of this week, post a best-effort response for each of the issues you are helping with on the other projects.
