## Project Idea: RPC and Two-Phase Commit!

This is a *very* classic exercise for all students, everywhere, learning about distributed systems!  It is a great thought exercise, and will use things we are/will be talking about in the course.  It has 3 pieces:

1) A durable key/value store.
2) A two-phase commit protocol to cooridnate writes to replicas of the key/value store.
3) RPC to coordinate the replica processes.



Use RPC to coordinate replica processes for two-phase commit for a durable key-value store.
